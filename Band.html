                        sound. At first, it was just jam sessions—unpolished, raw, and experimental. They would meet
                        after hours, playing until dawn, weaving together genres and sounds that didn’t quite fit into
                        the mainstream. Their early work was chaotic and dissonant, but there was something undeniable
                        about their energy. Their breakthrough came when they played at a local music festival in early
                        2022. The crowd was electrified, and a small but devoted fanbase began to take shape.
