                            sound. At first, it was just jam sessions—unpolished, raw, and experimental. They would meet
                            after hours, playing until dawn, weaving together genres and sounds that didn’t quite fit into
                            the mainstream. Their early work was chaotic and dissonant, but there was something undeniable
                            about their energy. -->
                            Stage Fright breakthrough came when they played at a local music festival in early
                            2022. The crowd was electrified, and a small but devoted fanbase began to take shape. In June 2022
                            Stage Fright joins Indie record label TNR Records. Over a few months, the band played at bars and 
                            spread the word about their upcoming debut album with the label. Stage Fright's " Prometheus" sold 
                            13k copies in the first week. Stage Fright released Music Videos for the Prometheus album.
